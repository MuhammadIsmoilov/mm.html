  <p style="text-align: center;font-size: 20px;">What is programming?
    Programming refers to a technological process for telling a computer which tasks to perform in order to solve problems. You can think of programming as a collaboration between humans and computers, in which humans create instructions for a computer to follow (code) in a language computers can understand. 
    
    Programming enables so many things in our lives. Here are some examples: 
    
    When you browse a website to find information, contact a service provider, or make a purchase, programming allows you to interact with the site’s on-page elements, such as sign-up or purchase buttons, contact forms, and drop-down menus.
    
    The programming behind a mobile app can make it possible for you to order food, book a rideshare service, track your fitness, access media, and more with ease. 
    
    Programming helps businesses operate more efficiently through different software for file storage and automation and video conferencing tools to connect people globally, among other things. 
    
    Space exploration is made possible through programming.  




    
    How does computer programming work?
    At its most basic, programming tells a computer what to do. First, a programmer writes code—a set of letters, numbers, and other characters. Next, a compiler converts each line of code into a language a computer can understand. Then, the computer scans the code and executes it, thereby performing a task or series of tasks. Tasks might include displaying an image on a webpage or changing the font of a section of text. 
    
    Most used programming languages
    Different programming languages enable programmers to write code that computers understand. According to a survey by Statista, the top five programming languages that developers use are: 
    
    JavaScript, used by 65.36% 
    
    HTML/CSS, used by 55.08%
    
    SQL, used by 49.43% 
    
    Python, used by 48.07% 
    
    TypeScript, used by 34.83% [1]
    
    Explore below what you can do with these programming languages: 
    
    JavaScript
    This language is used on every major web browser. JavaScript allows you to add complex features to a web page, such as content updates, interactive maps, and animated graphics, develop games, and more.

    HTML/CSS
    These languages are used to create web pages and web applications. You would use HTML (HyperText Markup Language) to build web page structure, while CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) would enable you to determine the page’s styling.
